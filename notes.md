# PSO vs PSO

- Linear Extra profit, RPDI


# Run

- DQN vs DQN
- DDPG vs DDPG - Delta issue

- PSO and DDPG continous - remove discretization, give range
    change in driver code

- PSO issue

# Create doc for the paper

## For 
- Check the theory / implementation of dqn.py against the original (dqn original paper, double dqn original paper)
- Hyperparameter from which paper? Identify which it mostly complies with
- What was done exactly and thoroughly in the code,
    - equation
    - Hyperparameter
    - update rule
